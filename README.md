#Ojas online-library-management-system

ABSTRACT : 
Online Library Management System is a system which maintains the information about the books present in the library, their authors, the members of library to whom books are issued, library staff and all. This is very difficult to organize manually. Maintenance of all this information manually is a very complex task. Owing to the advancement of technology, organization of an Online Library becomes much simple. The Online Library Management has been designed to computerize and automate the operations performed over the information about the members, book issues and returns and all other operations. This computerization of library helps in many instances of its maintenances. It reduces the workload of management as most of the manual work done is reduced.

The project aims and objectives that will be achieved after completion of this project are discussed in this subchapter. The aims and objectives are as follows:

 Online book request for issue, return and to extend the date .
 A search column to search availability of books.
 An Admin login page where admin can add books, issue books, take books, calculate fine amount and also update the books.

BACKGROUND OF PROJECT:

E-Library Management System is an application which refers to library systems which are generally small or medium in size. It is used by librarian to manage the library using a computerized system where he/she can add new books, videos and Page sources. Books and student maintenance modules are also included in this system which would keep track of the students using the library and also a detailed description about the books a library contains. With this computerized system there will be no loss of book record or member record which generally happens when a non computerized system is used. All these modules are able to help librarian to manage the library with more convenience and in a more efficient way as compared to library systems which are not computerized.

SYSTEM ANALYSIS:

We will discuss and analyze about the developing process of Library Management System including software requirement specification (SRS) and comparison between existing and proposed system . The functional and non functional requirements are included in SRS part to provide complete description and overview of system requirement before the developing process is carried out. Besides that, existing vs proposed provides a view of how the proposed system will be more efficient than the existing one.

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENT SPECIFICATION

   GENERAL DESCRIPTION PRODUCT DESCRIPTION:

      Library Management System is a computerized system which helps user(librarian) to manage the library daily activity in electronic format. It reduces the risk of paper work such as file lost, file damaged and time consuming.
      It can help user to manage the transaction or record more effectively and timesaving.

   PROBLEM STATEMENT:

      The problem occurred before having computerized system includes:

       File lost:
         When computerized system is not implemented file is always lost because of human environment.Some times due to some human error there may be a loss of records.

       File damaged:
         When a computerized system is not there file is always lost due to some accdent like spilling of water by some member on file accidentally. Besides some natural disaster like floods or fires may also damage the files.
   
       Difficult to search record:
         When there is no computerized system there is always a difficulty in searching of records if the records are large in number .
   
       Space consuming:
         After the number of records become large the space for physical storage of file and records also increases if no computerized system is implemented.

       Cost consuming:
         As there is no computerized system the to add each record paper will be needed which will increase the cost for the management of library.
